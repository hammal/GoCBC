# Signal
This is a module to define signals and some helper functions to create common such
signals.

By a signal we mean in the simplest sense a function that maps one space, typically
the time, into some output space. This definition contains both the meaning of
discrete time signals and continuous time signals where the only difference is the
input and output spaces of the corresponding signals.

For further information I recommend having a look at the respective function
descriptions.
