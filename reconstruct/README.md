# Reconstruction
Here the reconstruction algorithm is implemented which is derived from Factor-graphs
and Gaussian message passing, see paper [...](missing).

### Main Objective
- Given control contributions must be able to perform forward and backward message passing.

## Notes
- IDEA: Implement the Parallel Eigenvalue decomposition message passing!
